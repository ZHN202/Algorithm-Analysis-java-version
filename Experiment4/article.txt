Experiment 4. Binary Trees
1. Insert 3,1,4,6,9,7,5,2 into an initially empty binary search tree,
a) Show the process of the insertions (You can use Microsoft Word, Visio, WPS or other
software firstly, and finally you must convert it to a pdf file )
b) Use the class of BinarySearchTree in the textbook,
i.
Write a method to calculate the number of leaves.
ii.
Write methods of preorder, inorder and postorder traversal.
iii.
Write a method to calculate the height of a binary search tree.
iv.
Write a method to calculate the number of nodes.
c) In the main function,
i.
construct a binary search tree
ii.
call the above methods and print results of these callings.
2. Insert 3, 1,4,6,9,7,5,2 into an initially empty AVL tree.
a) Show the process of the insertions (You can use Microsoft Word, Visio, WPS or other
softwares firstly, and finally you must convert it to a pdf file )
b) Design a class of AVL tree by using the class of avlNode in the textbook,
i.
Write a program to calculate the number of leaves.
ii.
Write methods of preorder, inorder and postorder traversal.
iii.
Write a method to calculate the height of a binary search tree.
iv.
Write a method to calculate the number of nodes.
c) In the main function,
i.
construct a AVL tree
ii.
call the above methods and print results of these callings.
